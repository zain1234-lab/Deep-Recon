## üö© Key Features

### Reconnaissance & Fingerprinting
- **Comprehensive CMS Detection:**  
  Uncovers WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, and other platforms. Enumerates plugins, themes, users, configuration, and backup files. Detects outdated versions and exposed sensitive files for deeper risk analysis.

- **Technology Stack Detection:**  
  Goes beyond CMS ‚Äî fingerprints backend frameworks (Laravel, Django, Express, Spring, ASP.NET), server software (Apache, Nginx, PHP), and modern frontend stacks (React, Angular, Vue, jQuery, Bootstrap) using headers, cookies, meta tags, and content inspection.

- **WAF Detection and Bypass:**  
  Identifies common Web Application Firewalls and automatically generates custom headers for bypass attempts, improving scan coverage and reliability.

### Vulnerability Analysis
- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:**  
  Checks for XSS, SQL Injection, LFI, SSRF, Open Redirect, and more. Uses up-to-date payloads and evaluates both risk and exploitability for accurate prioritization.

- **Security Header Analysis:**  
  Audits key HTTP security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, and more). Flags weak or missing headers and provides actionable remediation advice.

- **Outdated Software & Exposed Config Detection:**  
  Detects known vulnerable versions of software and CMS, and identifies exposed configuration or debug files that could leak sensitive data.

### Threat Intelligence
- **CVE Lookup & Vulnerability Intelligence:**  
  Integrates CVE database lookups for discovered technologies, complete with scoring, exploitability checks, and caching to accelerate results during larger engagements.

### Infrastructure Recon
- **DNS Enumeration:**  
  Queries and enumerates A, NS, MX, and TXT records for domains. Supports caching and stealth options for efficient and low-profile recon.

- **WHOIS Lookup:**  
  Supports robust single, asynchronous, and bulk WHOIS queries with caching and proxy support, making it practical for both focused and large-scope assessments.

### Reporting & Export
- **Professional Report Generation:**  
  Creates clear, client-ready HTML reports with interactive and collapsible sections for findings, AI-powered analysis, and full raw data. Export findings to JSON for further processing or integration with other tools.

- **AI-Powered Analysis:**  
  Leverages AI for structured, prioritized, and actionable security recommendations, including risk assessment and remediation advice.

### Performance, Evasion, and Usability
- **Smart Caching:**  
  Uses SQLite and in-memory caching for fast lookups of CVE, DNS, and WHOIS data. Reduces redundant requests and speeds up repeated scans.

- **Stealth Mode:**  
  Features proxy support, random delays, and user-agent rotation to minimize detection and evade rate limits during active engagements.

- **Batch Operations:**  
  Handles bulk DNS, WHOIS, and recon scans to efficiently process large asset lists or entire organizations.

- **Interactive Reports:**  
  HTML reports are enhanced with collapsible sections, keyboard shortcuts, and smooth scrolling for maximum clarity and usability.
